# React Version Mismatch Issue

## Problem
There is a version mismatch between React (19.0.0-rc-66855b96-20241106) and ReactDOM (19.0.0) in the project.

## Attempted Solutions
1. Tried to locate and update package.json file
2. Searched for main application files
3. Attempted to find files importing React or ReactDOM

## Recommendations
1. Ensure both React and ReactDOM are updated to version 19.0.0
2. Review the entire codebase for compatibility with React 19
3. Update related dependencies and conduct thorough testing

## Next Steps
A more comprehensive review of the project structure and build process is needed to properly address this issue.
